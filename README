django-wordpress-parser is a module designed to ease the process of migrating
your blog from Wordpress to Django. This will not automatically convert
everything for you, but will help in some areas.

Currently the parser only provides an example of importing data into a custom
blog. There are no standard importers (yet).

However, comments can be imported to Django's standard comments application.
